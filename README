A (work in progress) implementation of the forth programming language written
in Rust.

Project goals:
	To write a forth implementation that follows the forth standard
	(https://forth-standard.org/) and implements the core words.

	To practice rust and forth

	To have fun

Core words to implement:
	fm/mod
	um*
	um/mod
	
	#
	#>
	#s
	<#
	hold
	sign
	
	>number


What's next:
       Some features I'll might implement in the future

       Implement the `Return` opcode using a primitive.
       Merge the `BranchOnFalse` and `Branch` opcodes.
       Implement the `Branch` opcode using a primitive.

       Move the dictionary to the data space.
       no_std for the core code. Use traits for a standard target.

       Floating point word set
       Exception word set

       Image system:
       	     Save and load the state of the current running program from disk.
	     Textual image format, for version control!
